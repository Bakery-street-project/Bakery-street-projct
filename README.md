# Bakery-street-projct

Baker Street Project - Advanced AI & Regulatory Technology

## Vision

**
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Emphasizes maintaining high code quality through native automated testing and building processes.

## Features

- Developed in **JavaScript**
- Well-structured and maintainable codebase
- Integration ready for development workflows
- Comprehensive documentation
- 2. **Stack**: Here, the technology stack is outlined, which includes Python as the primary programming language. `package.json` suggests the use of Node.js or a JavaScript runtime in combination with Python, possibly for frontend development or build processes.
- 3. **Missing**: This section probably identifies any gaps in the current setup, such as missing dependencies, documentation, or functionalities that need to be addressed.
- 4. **Monetization**: This is about how the project intends to generate revenue. It could involve selling the AI solutions, providing services, or licensing technology.
- 5. **Lua potential**: Lua is a lightweight programming language known for its simplicity and ease of embedding. Its inclusion here might indicate plans to integrate Lua scripts into the project, possibly for specific tasks or to handle certain components more efficiently.
- 6. **Security**: This section likely covers security measures implemented in the project, such as data protection, secure coding practices, compliance with regulatory standards, and possibly certifications or audits conducted to ensure safety and privacy.
